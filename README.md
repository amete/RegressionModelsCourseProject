# RegressionModelsCourseProject

In this project, we're asked to use the *mtcars* dataset and write up an analysis to
answer two main questions:

* "Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG"
* "Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"

To answer these questions we'll build a number of linear regression models in increased complexity
and compare them in terms of their performance.
